                    The path of the <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">righteous man</a> is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of <a href="mailto:dev@email.com">evil men</a>. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and goodwill, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brotherâ€™s keeper, and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee!
